## Introduction

This Snake game project was developed as part of a school project at ENSEIRB-MATMECA. The goal of this project was to create a functioning Snake game on an FPGA board using VHDL. The project utilizes a Nexys FPGA board and a PMOD RGB OLED display to provide an interactive gaming experience.

## Project Overview

- FPGA board: Digilent Nexys
- FPGA chip: C7A100T-1CSG324
- Display: PMOD RGB OLED (96x64 pixels)
- Language: VHDL

The game is a faithful reproduction of the classic Snake game, and it leverages the capabilities of the FPGA to provide an engaging gaming experience.
